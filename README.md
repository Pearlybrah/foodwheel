# foodwheel aka WTE
**WhatToEat**



#FINAL PROJECT LAYOUT
###OVERVIEW
To create a simple user experience of easily deciding what to eat when hungry. The user will login and create an account to store favorite cuisines and restaurants catered to the user specifically. The user then spins the roulette wheel and where the ball lands the user is then displayed a list of restaurants in relation to the cuisine randomly picked. The user then can like or dislike the restaurant and saved to their profile. Users can join other users “Tables” for a meal and the roulette table is then dynamically generated with each specific users choices of restaurants or cuisines.
